HAU AI collator is a POC used for testing the following features:

- Making Youtube videos play using VueJS components
- Implement a voice command recognition system that allows remote control of the learning materials
- Implement a chatbot that responds to queries to enhance learning experience of viewers.
- Showcase different edge-based AI capabilities and prove that we can build AI-enabled frontends with no backends
